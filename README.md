## Components

### 1. SearchHeader

The `SearchHeader` component allows users to search for videos. It includes an input field for entering the search query and a button to submit the search.

### 2. VideoCard

The `VideoCard` component represents an individual video in the search results or related videos list. It displays the video thumbnail, title, channel name, and upload date. Clicking on the video navigates to the video details page.

### 3. VideoDetail

The `VideoDetail` component displays detailed information about a selected video. It includes an embedded video player, video title, channel information, and video description. It also shows related videos from the same channel on the right side of the video.

### 4. ChannelInfo

The `ChannelInfo` component displays information about the channel that uploaded the video, including the channel's name and profile image.

### 5. ChannelPlaylist

The `ChannelPlaylist` component shows a list of related videos from the same channel.

## Context

### YoutubeApiContext

The `YoutubeApiContext` provides access to the YouTube API client. This context is used by various components to fetch video data.

## Styling

The application uses `Tailwind CSS` for styling. Tailwind CSS allows for easy and efficient styling by applying utility classes directly in the JSX code. The application supports a responsive design, adjusting the number of videos displayed based on the window size.
